# SBS Plate Tools
This project is a collection of utilities that supports working with SBS
plates (96 and 384 well) in PHP or Python.

Simple features such as getting the index of a well and vice versa are
supported in addition to slightly more involved feature such as figuring
out the location of a specific well from a 96 well plate that was
combined into a 384 layout.

The test suites will show you the basics in how to use this project.

It helped me when I originally developed it and maybe it'll help someone
else.


Formatting of the python files enforced like so:
    autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --aggressive sbstools.py
